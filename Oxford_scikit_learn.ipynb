Overfitting is when our model performs well on the training data but does not generalise to unseen data (such as our test set). The model might be too complex, with the parameter weights probably too large and too aligned too closely to the patterns of the training data. The solution is to develop a means of reducing these weights during training, and this is done through a process called **regularization**.\n",

        "* How we regularise the model depends on what estimator we are using. In most cases, we can penalise the increase in parameter weights as the model trains by inserting a regularization term to our model when we instantiate it. This is applicable to regression models, logistics regression and support vector classifiers (see below for implementations).  \n",
        "* For these estimators, the regularization term is commonly either **L1 Regularization**, where the weights are reduced by a user defined parameter multiplied by the absolute value of the weights (or coefficients); or **L2 Regularization**, where the weights are reduced by a user defined parameter multiplied by the squared sum of the weights.\n",
